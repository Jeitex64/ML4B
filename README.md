## Motivation
Our team wants to develop a machine learning program that can automatically detect fraudulent credit card transactions and flag them as such.

## 2 Related Work
What have others done in your area of work/to answer similar questions? Discuss existing work in the context of your project.

## 3 Methodology
### 3.1 General Methodology
How did you proceed to achieve your project goals? Describe the steps you undertook. Aim: Others should understand your research process.

### 3.2 Data Understanding and Preparation
Introduce the dataset to the reader. Describe the structure and size of your dataset. Describe any specialties. Explain how you prepared the dataset for your project.

### 3.3 Modeling and Evaluation
Describe the model architecture(s) you selected. Explain how you trained your models. Describe how you evaluated your models and which metrics you used.

## 4 Results
Describe what artifacts you have built. List the libraries and tools you used. Explain the concept of your app. Describe the results you achieved by applying your trained models on unseen data. Use descriptive language (no judgment, no discussion in this section -> just show what you built).

## 5 Discussion
Now it's time to discuss your results, artifacts, and app. Show the limitations (e.g., missing data, limited training resources/GPU availability in Colab, limitations of the app). Discuss your work from an ethics perspective: Dangers of the application of your work (for example, discrimination through ML models), transparency effects on climate change. Possible sources: Have a look at the "Automating Society Report"; have a look at this website and their publications. Further Research: What could be the next steps for other researchers (specific research questions).

## 6 Conclusion
Short summary of your findings and outlook.
